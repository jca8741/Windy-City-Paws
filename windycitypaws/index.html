                <h2>Kaite: Owner</h2>
                <h3>My love of dogs began as early as it gets</h3>
                <p>I can’t remember a time when I wasn’t begging my parents for a dog or dreaming of being a vet. Finally, when I was eight years old, we got our first family pet, a beautiful Golden Retriever named Ginger. I loved everything about having a furry companion – we did everything together! I’ve had a dog in my life ever since- two Golden Retrievers and one King Charles Cavalier Spaniel!</p>

                <h2>Julia: Manager</h2>
                <p>I moved to Chicago in 2013 and am originally from Alabama! When I first moved here, I missed our family dog Annie (awesome chocolate lab) so I looked into different things I could do that brought dogs back into my life! I called Katie and became a part of the incredible WCP team as a walker in the Lincoln Park area! I had such a great time walking and befriending the dogs of Chicago, I wanted to do more. I talked with Katie and became Walker Coordinator then eventually Manager! Katie is an incredible person to work with and for and I couldn’t see myself doing anything else! Since I became manager though, I missed my daily interactions with dogs, so Matt, my husband, and I adopted a beautiful and crazy mutt, named her Zelda, and she has become an amazing part of our family! In the evening I enjoy stage managing, performing, and doing other various jobs with different theaters in Chicago!</p>

                <h2>Marco: Field Operations Supervisor</h2>
                <p>I grew up in the burbs of Chicago before making my way to Pittsburg to study graphic design and then moving back to Chicago in 2012. I have been around animals practically my whole life, having grown up in a veritable zoo of dogs, cats, birds, fish, and small furry critters and now owning two absolutely ridiculous rescue pit-mixes Mako and Hercules, affectionally dubbed the Nerd Herd. I’ve been a regular fixture in the pet community around Andersonville for a little over 3 years and I’m excited to apply all I’ve learned to my work here at Windy City Paws! When not constantly surrounding myself with all sorts of animals I also enjoy cooking, Lego building, and DMing for a DnD group.</p>
